# First, make sure IPv6 forwarding is disabled. Edit
# /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 and change

# Now, while we could leave it at that, you might notice that some sites will
# load slowly and some things will time out. This is because your client is
# trying to connect to an IPv6 address. To prevent this, we have to specifically
# reject all IPv6 connections from the OpenVPN clients.
# On a firewall manager like ufw, you will want to execute:
sudo ufw reject from 2001:db8:0:123::/64 to any

sudo service openvpn restart

# Now test on the client for ipv6 leak by navigating to http://ipv6leak.com/
